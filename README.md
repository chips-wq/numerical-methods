These are implementations I wrote during the course I took on Numerical Methods in my first year at university.

They are about solving large systems through direct or iteration techniques, calculating eigenvalues to arbitrary accuracy.

There are also implementations of Simpson and Trapezoidal rule to calculate integrals.

Euler's method for approximating ODE and also RK2, which is based on euler.
